Have you ever heard of the "clean architecture"? 

Maybe you've heard it by a different name...

[Clean Architecture](https://blog.cleancoder.com/uncle-bob/2012/08/13/the-clean-architecture.html), the [Onion Architecture](https://jeffreypalermo.com/2008/07/the-onion-architecture-part-1/), [Ports & Adapters](http://www.dossier-andreas.net/software_architecture/ports_and_adapters.html), [Hexigonal Architecture](http://alistair.cockburn.us/Hexagonal+architecture), the Layered Architecture, DCI (Data, Context and Interaction), etc.

They're all a little bit different in implementation, but for our understanding: they all mean the same thing.

> Separation of concerns at the architectural level

I first discovered the term when I read "[Clean Architecture](https://www.amazon.ca/gp/product/0134494164/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&tag=stemmlerjs09-20&camp=15121&creative=330641&linkCode=as2&creativeASIN=0134494164&linkId=32995f69d0747d8723d42ffdda296878)" by Robert C. Martin (Uncle Bob) (which, despite some negative reviews is actually an incredible read and I highly recommend you check it out).

After reading his book and spending some time [learning the SOLID principles](/articles/solid-principles/solid-typescript/), not only did I enjoy the fact that the flexibilty and testability of my code improved, but I became _way more confident_ tackling <u>complex software development problems</u> with TypeScript and Node.js.

In this article, I'll cover:

<ul class="aside">
  <li>How the clean architecture separates the concerns of your code</li>
  <li>How it enables you to write testable code</li>
  <li>How it also enables you to write flexible code</li>
</ul>

## Understanding the Clean Architecture

### Policy vs. Detail

When we're writing code, at any given time, we're either writing **Policy** or **Detail**.

![](/img/blog/clean-architecture/policy-vs-detail.svg)

**Policy** is when we're specifying what should happen, and _when_. 

**Policy** is mostly concerned with the business-logic, rules and abstractions that exist in the domain that we're coding in.

**Detail** is when we specify _how_ the **policy** happens.

**Details** actually enforce the policy. **Details** are implementations of the policy.

An easy way to figure out if the code you're writing is _detail_ or _policy_ is to ask yourself:

- does this code enforce a rule about how something should work in my domain?
- or does this code simply _make something work_

For that reason: frameworks (like [Nest.js](https://nestjs.com/) and [Express.js](https://expressjs.com/)), npm libraries (like [lodash](https://lodash.com), [RxJs](https://rxjs-dev.firebaseapp.com/) or [Redux](https://redux.js.org/)) <u>are details</u>.

Again,

> The ultimate goal of the Clean Architecture is to separate Policy vs. Detail at the architectural level.

So let's see what that looks like:

### Layered Architecture

![](/img/blog/clean-architecture/group.svg)

_Those small half-circles are meant to signify writing interfaces (at the policy level) to be implemented by the detail level_.

This diagram is a sort of simplification of all of the other diagrams I found. There's more than just these two layers. But for our understanding of the concept, its much easier to think about a clean architecture like this.

<u>So what does this mean?</u>

In one layer (domain) we have all of the important stuff: the _entities_, _business logic_, _rules_ and _events_. This is the <u>irreplaceable</u> stuff in our software that we can't just swap out for another library or framework.

The other layer (infra) contains everything that actually _spins up_ the code in the domain layer to execute.

You'll recall that this is [the biggest challenge in MVC](/articles/enterprise-typescript-nodejs/when-crud-mvc-isnt-enough/), figuring out what the "M" should do and how it does it. Well, this is it. The "M" = that Domain Layer.

Here's an illustration how a RESTful HTTP call might cause code to be executed across our entire architecture. 

![](/img/blog/clean-architecture/execution-cycle.svg)

There's a pattern here with respect to the <u>direction of dependencies</u>.

### The Dependency Rule

In Uncle Bob's book, he describes **the dependency rule**.

That rule specifies that something declared in an outer circle <u>must not be mentioned in the code by an inner circle</u>.

_In other diagrams, there are many more layers. The rule still applies._

That means that code can only point inwards.

Domain Layer code can't depend on Infrastructure Layer code.

But Infrastructure Layer Code _can depend_ on Domain Layer code (because it goes inwards).

When we follow this rule, we're essentially following the [Dependency Inversion](dependency-inversion/) rule from the [SOLID Principles](/articles/solid-principles/solid-typescript/).

### Ports and Adapters way of thinking about Clean Architecture

The **ports and adapters** approach to thinking about this is that the _interfaces_ and _abstract classes_ are the **Ports** and the [concrete classes](/wiki/concrete-class/) (ie: the implementations) are the **adapters**.

Let's visualize it.

Let's say I was to design an `IEmailService` interface. It specifies all of the things that an _Email Service_ can do. But it doesn't actually implement any of those things specifically.

```typescript
export interface IEmailService {
  sendMail(mail: IMail): Promise<IMailTransmissionResult>; 
}
```

Here's my little **Port**.

![](/img/blog/clean-architecture/email-service-1.svg)

And let's say I'm just wiring up some code that relies on an `IEmailService`.

```typescript
class EmailNotificationsService implements IHandle<AccountVerifiedEvent> {
  private emailService: IEmailService;
  constructor (emailService: IEmailService) {
    DomainEvents.register(this.onAccountVerifiedEvent, AccountVerifiedEvent.name)
  }

  private onAccountVerifiedEvent (event: AccountVerifiedEvent): void {
    emailService.sendMail({
      to: event.user.email,
      from: 'me@khalilstemmler.com',
      message: "You're in, my dude"
    })
  }
}
```

Because I'm referring to **policy**, all that's left to do is to create the **implementation** (the details).

```typescript
// We can define several valid implementations.
// This infra-layer code relies on the Domain layer email service.
class MailchimpEmailService implements IEmailService {
  sendMail(mail: IMail): Promise<IMailTransmissionResult> {
    // alg
  }
}

class SendGridEmailService implements IEmailService {
  sendMail(mail: IMail): Promise<IMailTransmissionResult> {
    // alg
  }
}

class MailgunEmailService implements IEmailService {
  sendMail(mail: IMail): Promise<IMailTransmissionResult> {
    // alg
  }
}
```

![](/img/blog/clean-architecture/email-service-2.svg)

When I go to hook this thing up, I have several options available now.

```typescript
// index.js
import { EmailNotificationsService } from './services/EmailNotificationsService'
import { MailchimpEmailService } from './infra/services/MailchimpEmailService'
import { SendGridEmailService } from './infra/services/SendGridEmailService'
import { MailgunEmailService } from './infra/services/MailgunEmailService'

const mailChimpService = new MailchimpEmailService();
const sendGridService = new SendGridEmailService();
const mailgunService = new MailgunEmailService();

// I can pass in any of these since they are all valid IEmailServices
new EmailNotificationsService(mailChimpService) 
```

Look! The port fits the adapter ❤️.

Hopefully we're starting to see how this can make our code more  **testable** and **flexible**.


## Code is testable

If you follow the dependency rule, domain layer code has 0 dependencies.

You know what that means? 

> We can actually test it

Next time you're writing code, think about it like this...

Before you get too far along working on some classes, ask yourself: "can I _mock_ what I just wrote?"

If you were following [SOLID](/articles/solid-principles/solid-typescript/) and referring to **interfaces** or **abstract classes**, the answer will be _yes_.

If you've been referring to concretions, it'll be considerably more challenging to write tests for it. This is caused by [coupling](/wiki/dependency-inversion/).

## Code is flexible

When we've separated the concerns between Policy and Detail, we create an explicit relationship that we know how to deal with.

If we change the policy, we _might_ end up affecting the detail (since detail depends on policy).

But if we change the detail, it should <u>never affect the policy</u> because policy doesn't depend on detail.

This separation of concerns, combined with adhering to the [SOLID](/articles/solid-principles/solid-typescript/) principles makes changing code a lot easier.

### Tests?

The only way we can be certain about changing code is to have written tests for it. 

Domain code is incredibly easy to test (since it has 0 dependencies) and refers to abstractions. We can really easily create mocks for things by implementing the interface with our mock classes.

Infrastructure layer code is a little bit more challenging (and slower) to test because it has dependencies (web servers, caches, key-value object stores like Redis, etc).

## Too clean?

The more complex the software you're building, and the more robust it needs to be, the <u>more you need to build into it, the mechanisms for flexibility</u>.

For example: if you're writing a quick Node.js script to scrape a particular web page periodically so that you can automate something, **don't spend _too much time_ trying to make your code SOLID**.

But, if you're building a web scraper that needs to _know how to scrape all of the 100 most popular job boards in the world_, then you might want to consider coding it for flexibility. 

```typescript
// Define the abstraction to implement the algorithms
abstract class BaseScraper {
  constructor () {
    this.puppeteer = new Puppeteer();
  }
  abstract getNumberPages (): Promise<number>;
  abstract getJobTitle (): Promise<HTML>;
  abstract getJobDescription(): Promise<HTML>;
  abstract getJobPaymentDetails(): Promise<HMTL>;
}

// Implement the algorithms
class LinkedInScraper extends BaseScraper {
  constructor () {
    super();
  }

  getNumberPages (): Promise<number> {
    // implement algorithm
    this.puppeteer...
  }

  getJobTitle (): Promise<HTML> {
    // implement algorithm
  }

  getJobDescription(): Promise<HTML> {
    // implement algorithm
    
  }

  getJobPaymentDetails(): Promise<HMTL> {
    // implement algorithm
  }
}

class GlassdoorScraper extends BaseScraper {
  constructor () {
    super();
  }
  
  getNumberPages (): Promise<number> {
    // implement algorithm
    this.puppeteer...
  }

  getJobTitle (): Promise<HTML> {
    // implement algorithm
  }

  getJobDescription(): Promise<HTML> {
    // implement algorithm
    
  }

  getJobPaymentDetails(): Promise<HMTL> {
    // implement algorithm
  }
}

```
