The term _Use Case_ is used to describe one of the potential ways that our software can be used.

Another word that's sometimes used is _feature_, though the concept is nearly identical.

The whole purpose of building software is to <u>address one or more Use Cases</u>. 

In large projects, it can sometimes be hard to determine what the capabilities of the system are. 

That's incredibly true on [CRUD apps designed API-first](/articles/enterprise-typescript-nodejs/when-crud-mvc-isnt-enough/).

What if there was a particular _construct_ that actually **appeared** in our code that would **describe** all of the different capabilities of our app?

Something that would help towards encapsulating, organizing, and keeping track of all of the things that our application is capable of.

Well, it _does_ exist, and it's properly called: _you guessed it_, a **Use Case**.

---

In the [Clean Architecture](/articles/enterprise-typescript-nodejs/clean-nodejs-architecture/), Use Cases are an **application layer** concern that encapsulate the business logic involved in executing the features within our app(s).

In this article, we'll cover the following topics towards structuring Node.js/TypeScript applications using Use Cases in the application layer:

## Discovering Use Cases

There are several different ways to plan out building an application. For a long time, I simply planned out how I would actually build something by designing the API first.

Later on, I ended up moving more towards wire-framing and starting from the interface first, because the front-end would often dictate what's really needed and what's [YAGNI](/wiki/yagni/).

It wasn't until the projects I started working on got so complex that I realized I needed to take a more traditional approach to software planning: **Use Case design**.

### Traditional approach

There's a traditional approach to identifying and drawing Use Cases using a **Use Case Diagram**. 

In Use Case Diagrams, the stick-man represents an `actor` of our system (someone who uses it), and the circles represent all of the actual use cases that we'd like to enable them to execute with our software.

![Traditional Use Case Diagrams](/img/blog/enterprise-node/use-cases/use-case-diagram-tra.png)

I think it's a good to know how to create these, but rarely do I ever start designing a system with the sole purpose of generating one of these documents. 

Instead, I try to identify the essential components through conversation and draw things out using a kind of free-form approach.

### Use Case Basics

The most important things to understand about identifying use cases are:

- 1. Who the `actors` of the system are (who's executing the use cases)
- 2. That use cases are either **commands** or **queries** 
- 3. That use cases belong to a particular **subdomain** which may be deployed on separate **bounded contexts**

#### 1. Actors

It's easy to just call every `actor` a `User`. We could do that, but it doesn't say much about the domain itself. 

There's a time and place to call a user a `User`, like in an **Identity & Access Management** subdomain like Amazon IAM or Auth0, but we should try to be as expressive as we can about identifying the actual `actors` in our systems by thinking about their _role_ in the domain.

Here are some alternatives to `User` depending on the domain:

- A billing system: `Customer`, `Subscriber`, `Accountant`, `Treasurer`, `Employee`
- A blogging system: `Editor`, `Reviewer`, `Guest`, `Author`
- A recruitment platform: `JobSeeker`, `Employer`, `Interviewer`, `Recruiter`
- Our vinyl-trading application: `Trader`, `Admin`
- An email marketing company: `Contact`, `Recipient`, `Sender`,  `ListOwner`

Get the point? **Role** matters.

#### 2. Use Cases are Commands and Queries

A Use Case will be either a **command** or a **query**.

For example, in our Vinyl-Trading app, ["White Label"](https://github.com/stemmlerjs/white-label), an example of a particular **command** is to **add vinyl to our wishlist**. That might appear in our code as a class called `AddVinylToWishlist`.

An example of a **query** would be to **get our wishlist**, which might appear as `GetWishlist`.

#### 3. Use cases belong to a particular **subdomain**

Generally speaking, most applications are built up of _several_ subdomains.

If you don't remember what a **subdomain** from [domain-driven design](/articles/categories/domain-driven-design) is, it's a logical separation of the **entire problem domain**. 

> A subdomain is a logical separation of the **entire problem domain**. 

What's the problem domain?

For example, White Label, the Vinyl-Trading app that I'm building, is about trading vinyl.

But the problem domain isn't _only_ about enabling traders to trade vinyl. There's much more that needs to be accounted for. 

In addition to the trading aspect (`Trading`), the enterprise also has to account for several other subdomains: identity and access management (`Users`), cataloging items (`Catalog`), billing (`Billing`), notifications and more.

![White Label subdomains](/img/blog/enterprise-node/use-cases/subdomains.svg)

In any [domain-driven](/articles/categories/domain-driven-design) project, we're usually able to decompose the entire problem domain into separate subdomains; some of which are <u>essential</u> that _we_ develop ourselves (like the `Trading` and probably `Catalog` subdomain), and some of which we might be able to just use a vendor (like Auth0 for `Users & Identity` or Stripe for `Billing`).

Large _monolith_ applications with minimal coupling between subdomains are said to be logically separate. 

![White Label folder structure](/img/blog/enterprise-node/use-cases/folder-structure.png)

<div class="caption">A good start and a rule of thumb is to keep monolith project subdomains separate by folder. This improves readability as well (see "<a href="https://blog.cleancoder.com/uncle-bob/2011/09/30/Screaming-Architecture.html">Screaming Architecture</a>").</div>

If our fictional enterprise application needed to scale out, that _logical_ separation would be **essential** in order for us to _physically_ separate our problem domain into several <u>independently deployable units</u>. 

In other words: microservices. 

In [DDD](/articles/categories/domain-driven-design)-lingo: separate **bounded-contexts**.

### We discover use cases through conversation

A huge misconception about software development is that developers just code away in the corner and never have to talk to people. 

That's _so_ not true. So much of software development (especially in DDD) is consistently attempting to identify the correct language to effectively create a lasting software implementation of the model from real life.

---

Here's an example of the conversation to discover some of the Use Cases in White Label.

> "So, I have this idea for an app. It's an app where you can trade vinyl with other people."

"OK, cool. So like, Discogs?"

"Yeah, pretty much. But it's only for vinyl. True hipsters."

"Awesome, I like it. What if I don't want to trade my vinyl? Can I just _buy_ something?"

"Yeah, let's say: you can either trade your own vinyl for someone elses, or you can _trade_ them money for it instead."

"Oh, what about this? Users can make complex offers, like hey, I'll give you these 2 Devo albums, a Sex Pistols album and 60 bucks for that limited edition Birthday Party vinyl".

"Ah, so there's `offers` and `trades`. And an `offer` can include several records and/or money in exchange for one or more records. And the person who receives the offer can either accept it, or decline the offer."

"Yeah, that sounds pretty accurate. And if they want to decline it, they can decline 'with comments' or something, saying why they decline it, and give them another reason to make another offer."

"Yeah ok cool."

"So what are the use cases we've discovered so far?"

"

- `MakeOffer(offer: Offer)`
- `DeclineOffer(offerId: OfferId, comments?: string)`
- `AcceptOffer(offerId: OfferId)`

"

"Probably also the ability to _get_ all the offers, and _get_ an offer by id. We have to think about the UI as well. It's going to need some use cases."

"Ah, yes. So also `GetAllOffers(userId: User)`, `GetOfferById(offerId: OfferId)`".

"Hmm, where did `User` come from?"

"That's what we've been talking about this whole time, no? Things `Users` can do."

"Yeah, but not really. Let's think about the [Ubiquitous Language](https://www.google.com/search?q=ubiquitous+language&oq=ubiquitous+language&aqs=chrome..69i57.6981j0j7&sourceid=chrome&ie=UTF-8) here. With respect to this `Trading` subdomain and their _role_, it would make more sense to call them `Traders`, or `RecordCollectors`.

"Ahh, I see, the term `User` probably belongs more in a `Users & Identity` subdomain, not a... `Trading` subdomain, which is what we've been discussing so far, right?"

"Yeah, that's right."

"OK, let's go with `Traders`."

"Awesome. So far, in the `Trading` subdomain, the Use Cases we have are: 

- `MakeOffer(offer: Offer)`
- `DeclineOffer(offerId: OfferId, comments?: string)`
- `AcceptOffer(offerId: OfferId)` 
- `GetAllOffers(traderId: TraderId)` and
- `GetOfferById(offerId: offerId)` 

I can't think of anything else yet."

"Me neither, let's go with that for now."

"And it looks like we've identified some of the Entities as well. `Offer`  and `Trader`, right?"

"Yeah, `Offer` is probably going to be an Aggregate Root for all of the `OfferItems` as well (a collection of money + vinyl). We can figure that out later. Sounds good so far.

"Oh, and since we brought up the `Users & Identity` subdomain, should we address that as well?"

"Eh, yeah- we could. It's probably going to the same as every other app."

"What do you mean?"

"Well, the use cases are pretty common. There's normally like something like: 

- `login(userEmail: UserEmail, password: UserPassword)` 
- `logout(authToken: JWTToken)`
- `verifyEmail(emailVerificationToken: EmailVerificationToken)` 
- `changePassword(passwordResetToken: Token, password: UserPassword)`

You know what I mean? You've probably done this plenty of times."

"Ah, isn't that something we could probably outsource?"

"Yeah, we could probably try [Auth0](https://auth0.com/) for that."

"What do they call that in DDD-lingo, again? The type of subdomain..."

"A generic subdomain."

"Meaning?"

"Meaning it might be a critical part of the business, yeah, but it's not the _core_ of the business. The core is probably going to be the `Trading` subdomain".

"Right. That'll be the core subdomain because that's essentially the 'unique' thing about our app that can't just be outsourced our bought off the shelf."

## The role of the Application Layer

If you've been following the series on [Enterprise Node.js + TypeScript](/articles/categories/enterprise-node-type-script), you'll recall that the [Domain Layer](/articles/enterprise-typescript-nodejs/clean-nodejs-architecture/) holds all of the [entities](/articles/typescript-domain-driven-design/entities/), [value objects](/articles/typescript-value-object/), has 0 dependencies to outer layers, and is the _first_ place that we aim to place business logic, especially if it pertains to one particular entity.

For example, in White Label, if I were trying to figure out where to place [invariant logic](/wiki/invariant/) that would ensure that a `Vinyl` can only have up to at max 3 different `Genre`s, _that logic_ would belong in the `Vinyl` class (which is an **aggregate root**).

```typescript
class Vinyl extends AggregateRoot<VinylProps> {
  ...

  addGenre (genre: Genre): Result<any> {
    if (this.props.genres.length >= MAX_NUMBER_OF_GENRES_PER_VINYL) {
      return Result.fail<any>('Max number of genres reached')
    } 

    if (!this.genreAlreadyExists(genre)) {
      this.props.genres.push(genre)
    }

    return Result.ok<any>();
  }
}
```

<div class="caption">Ensuring domain model integrity by placing validation logic within the model itself.</div>

`Vinyl` is one of many domain models from the **Domain Layer** from the `Catalog` subdomain.

![Catalog subdomain from our Vinyl-Trading app](/img/blog/enterprise-node/use-cases/catalog-subdomain.svg)

OK, so we generally understand what the Domain layer is for. And we remember that the **infrastructure layer** contains external services and things that we don't want to muddy our inner layers with (controllers, databases, caches, etc).

So then, what's the role of the **application layer**?

> The application layer contains the **Use Cases** for a **particular subdomain** in our application.

The use cases describe the _features_ of the **application**, which may be independently deployed or deployed as a monolith. 

That means that when we put the use cases directly into a subdomain, we can understand the capabilities of that subdomain right away.

Let's look at how we might structure a project around use cases.

### Structuring projects around use cases

Uncle Bob identified a pattern called "[Screaming Architecture](https://www.google.com/search?q=screaming+architecture&oq=screaming+architecture&aqs=chrome..69i57.5406j0j7&sourceid=chrome&ie=UTF-8)". It means that by just looking at the project structure itself, it should be figuratively _screaming_ at us: the **type** of project we're working on, in addition to the capabilities of the system. 

Here's a little bit of what it looks like in White Label when we split it into `Subdomain` => `Use Cases` + `entities`. 

![Projects are structured around use cases and domain models](/img/blog/enterprise-node/use-cases/structured-around-use-cases.png)

At a glance, this tells us a _ton_ about what the `users` subdomain is and what it does, in addition to what the `catalog` subdomain is and what it does.

## A Use Case interface

Use Cases are simple in principle. They have an optional request and response.

```typescript
export interface UseCase<IRequest, IResponse> {
  execute (request?: IRequest) : Promise<IResponse> | IResponse;
}
```

Employing the design principle of "always programming to an interface and not an implementation", we can create an interface to represent a Use Case like this.

Simple enough, right?

## Implementing a Use Case

Let's take a look at how we might implement this. Let's do the `AddVinylToCatalogUseCase` from the `Catalog` subdomain.

First, we'll create the class and implement the interface, using `any` for the Generic [DTOs (data transmission objects)](/articles/typescript-domain-driven-design/repository-dto-mapper/).

```typescript
export class AddVinylToCatalogUseCase implements UseCase<any, any> {
  public async execute (request: any): Promise<any> {
    return null;
  }
}
```

Alright, so in order to update a `Vinyl`, we need to provide everything necessary in order to **create** it, in addition to the `Trader`'s id that we're adding it to. 

Let's put all of that in the request DTO.

```typescript
interface AddVinylToCatalogUseCaseRequestDTO {
  vinylName: string;
  artistNameOrId: string;
  traderId: string;
  genresArray?: string | string[];
}

export class AddVinylToCatalogUseCase 
  implements UseCase<AddVinylToCatalogUseCaseRequestDTO, any> {
    
  async execute (request: AddVinylToCatalogUseCaseRequestDTO) : Promise<any> {
    return null;
  }
}
```

We're ready to actually implement the use case algorithm now. 

Since our `Vinyl` aggretate root class needs an actual instance of an `Artist`, we'll have to determine whether to retrieve the artist by `id` or by `artistName`. 

If the request fails, we'll use our [result class](/articles/enterprise-typescript-nodejs/handling-errors-result-class/) to safely return an error, otherwise we'll use a `VinylRepo` to save the `Vinyl` to persistence. 

So we'll need to use [Dependency Injection](/articles/solid-principles/solid-typescript/) to inject a `VinylRepo` and an `ArtistRepo`. 

We can include that as a dependency in the `constructor` for this class.

```typescript
interface AddVinylToCatalogUseCaseRequestDTO {
  vinylName: string;
  artistNameOrId: string;
  traderId: string;
  genresArray?: string | string[];
}

export class AddVinylToCatalogUseCase 
  implements UseCase<AddVinylToCatalogUseCaseRequestDTO, Result<Vinyl>> {

  private vinylRepo: IVinylRepo;
  private artistRepo: IArtistRepo;

  constructor (vinylRepo: IVinylRepo, artistRepo: IArtistRepo) {
    this.vinylRepo = vinylRepo;
    this.artistRepo = artistRepo;
  }

  public async execute (request: AddVinylToCatalogUseCaseRequestDTO): Promise<Result<Vinyl>> {
    return null;
  }
}
```

Alright, now let's hook up the logic.

```typescript
export interface AddVinylToCatalogUseCaseRequestDTO {
  vinylName: string;
  artistNameOrId: string;
  traderId: string;
  genresArray?: string | string[];
}

export class AddVinylToCatalogUseCase 
  implements UseCase<AddVinylToCatalogUseCaseRequestDTO, Result<Vinyl>> {

  private vinylRepo: IVinylRepo;
  private artistRepo: IArtistRepo;

  constructor (vinylRepo: IVinylRepo, artistRepo: IArtistRepo) {
    this.vinylRepo = vinylRepo;
    this.artistRepo = artistRepo;
  }

  public async execute (request: AddVinylToCatalogUseCaseRequestDTO): Promise<Result<Vinyl>> {
    const { vinylName, artistNameOrId, traderId, genresArray } = request;
    let artist: Artist;

    const isArtistId = TextUtil.isUUID(artistNameOrId);

    if (isArtistId) {
      artist = await this.artistRepo.findById(artistNameOrId);
    } else {
      artist = await this.artistRepo.findByArtistName(artistNameOrId);
    }

    if (!!artist) {
      artist = Artist.create({ 
        name: ArtistName.create(artistNameOrId).getValue(), genres: [] 
      }).getValue();
    }

    const vinylOrError = Vinyl.create({
      title: vinylName,
      artist: artist,
      traderId: TraderId.create(new UniqueEntityID(traderId)),
      genres: []
    });

    if (vinylOrError.isFailure) {
      return Result.fail<Vinyl>(vinylOrError.error)
    } 

    const vinyl = vinylOrError.getValue()

    await this.vinylRepo.save(vinyl);
    return Result.ok<Vinyl>(vinyl)
  }
}
```

That's it! Now how do we hook this up to our application?

## Use cases are infrastructure-layer concern agnostic

Use Cases are agnostic to how we hook them up. 

As long as we can provide the inputs, they can execute **commands** and **queries** on our system.

That means that they can be hooked up by Express.js `controllers` or any other external services from the **infrastructure layer**.

```typescript
import { BaseController } from "../../../../../infra/http/BaseController";
import { AddVinylToCatalogUseCase } from "./CreateJobUseCase";
import { DecodedExpressRequest } from "../../../../../domain/types";
import { AddVinylToCatalogUseCaseRequestDTO } from "./AddVinylToCatalogUseCaseRequestDTO";

export class AddVinylToCatalogUseCaseController extends BaseController {
  private useCase: AddVinylToCatalogUseCase; 

  public constructor (useCase: AddVinylToCatalogUseCase) {
    super();
    this.useCase = useCase;
  }

  public async executeImpl (): Promise<any> {
    const req = this.req as DecodedExpressRequest;
    const { traderId } = req.decoded;
    const requestDetails = req.body as AddVinylToCatalogUseCaseRequestDTO;
    const resultOrError = await this.useCase.execute({
      ...requestDetails,
      traderId
    });
    if (resultOrError.isSuccess) {
      return this.ok(this.res, resultOrError.getValue());
    } else {
      return this.fail(resultOrError.error);
    }
  }
}
```

Use cases can **also** be executed by _other Use Cases_ from within the **application layer** as well (but not from the Domain-layer as per Uncle Bob's [Dependency Rule](/articles/enterprise-typescript-nodejs/clean-nodejs-architecture/)). And that's _really_ cool.

## Elegant usage of Use Case with Domain Events

There's actually a really elegant way to **chain** Use Cases together. 

You'd want to chain Use Cases together when one event might <u>trigger</u> another Use Case to be executed in certain scenarios. In Domain-Driven Design, we'd identify this behaviour through an [Event storming exercise](https://philippe.bourgau.net/how-to-use-event-storming-to-introduce-domain-driven-design/) and use the **Observer pattern** to emit Domain Events.

### Notifying traders when an item from their wishlist is added

In White Label, traders can add either `artist`s or specific `vinyl` to their `wishlist`. Whenever someone adds a new `vinyl` to their collection, traders that are interested in that particular `vinyl` or `artist` will be notified that it was posted. That way, they can make an `offer` to the owner for the `vinyl` that they're interested in.

The following diagram is a simplification of the communication between layers and use cases. 

![Projects are structured around use cases and domain models](/img/blog/enterprise-node/use-cases/diagram.svg)

At scale, if we wanted to deploy our subdomains as microservices instead of running it as a monolith in a single process, we could utilize a message broker like [RabbitMQ](https://www.rabbitmq.com/) or [Amazon MQ](https://aws.amazon.com/amazon-mq/).

We'll follow up with the nitty-gritty on hooking up Domain Events to execute chained Use Cases in a de-coupled way using the observer pattern in a future article.
