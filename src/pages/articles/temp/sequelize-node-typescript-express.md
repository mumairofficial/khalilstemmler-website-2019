  For building Node.js applications, Sequelize is my personal favourite ORM. I've battle-tested it in production with a handful of real-life projects and it's still my first choice for interacting with a relational database. Here's a walkthrough of my production setup with Node.js, TypeScript and Jest.

I'm currently working on an open-source TypeScript/Node.js application called _[White Label](https://github.com/stemmlerjs/white-label)_ where users can trade vinyl with each other. I'm building it for the purpose of teaching developers how to organize complex domain-logic using [Domain-Driven Design](/articles/domain-driven-design-intro/).  

In that project, I've gone the traditional route of using a relational database. 

And my favourite ORM for interacting with relational databases is [Sequelize](http://docs.sequelizejs.com/).

In this quick article, I'll walk you though my project setup.

## The Sequelize ORM

Sequelize has been around for a while. When I first started building apps with Node.js in 2014, Sequelize was the most mature ORM around at the time. 

There are some other awesome looking ORMs out there today, but because I've personally battle-tested Sequelize over time, it's normally been my first choice. They've even released [official v5 TypeScript typings](http://docs.sequelizejs.com/manual/typescript).

## 
```bash
white-label
  └ bin 
    └ www.ts    # This is the startup script that boots the webserver
  └ dist        # Builds go here
  └ scripts  
    └ db
      └ create.js
      └ delete.js
  └ sequelize
    └ config
    └ migrations
    └ seeders
    runner.ts   # 
  .env
  .sequelizerc
  .jest.config.js
```
