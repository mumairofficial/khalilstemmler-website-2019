title: Refactoring
author: Martin Fowler
category: Development
description: >-
  Fowler shows you how to flip between coding and refactoring, how often you should be committing your code and when you should be writing your tests. Highly recommended. The latest version of this book was updated to present the examples in JavaScript, which was an added plus for me since it’s my favorite language.
